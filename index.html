    <img style="float:left;height:500px;width:500px;" src="antarctica.jpg">
    <ol><li>Antarctica, the southernmost continent and site of the South Pole, is a virtually uninhabited, ice-covered landmass. Most cruises to the continent visit the Antarctic Peninsula, which stretches toward South America. It’s known for the Lemaire Channel and Paradise Harbor, striking, iceberg-flanked passageways, and Port Lockroy, a former British research station turned museum. The peninsula’s isolated terrain also shelters rich wildlife, including many penguins.
    </li><br>
    <li>
        Antarctica is the highest, driest, coldest and windiest continent on Earth
Antarctica covers 14.2 million square kilometres (5.5 million square miles)
The Antarctic ice sheet is the largest ice store on earth
Its landmass covers 14 million kilometres (5.4 million square miles)
Its mass is 30 million cubic metres (7.2 million cubic miles)
Its average depth is 2,160 metres (7,000 feet), with a maximum depth of 4,776 metres (15,669 feet
Ice covers roughly 98% of Antarctica, which equates to 90% of the Earth’s ice and 70% of our fresh water
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Antarctica holds most of the world's fresh water
An incredible 60-90% of the world’s fresh water is locked in Antarctica’s vast ice sheet. The Antarctic ice sheet is the largest on Earth, covering an incredible 14 million km² (5.4 million square miles) of Antarctic mountain ranges, valleys and plateaus. This leaves only 1% of Antarctica permanently ice-free. Some areas are ice-free in the summer, including many of the areas we visit on the Antarctic Peninsula.

At its deepest, Antarctica’s ice is 4.5 kilometres (2.7 miles) thick – that’s half the height of Mt Everest! If it all melted, global sea levels would rise about 60 metres (200 feet).
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Antarctica is a desert
With all of that fresh water held in the ice sheet, how could Antarctica be a desert?

When most of us think of deserts we think of sand dunes and sizzling temperatures, but technically a desert doesn’t have to be hot or sandy, it’s more about how much precipitation the area receives as rain, snow, mist or fog. A desert is any region that receives very little annual precipitation.

The average annual rainfall at the South Pole over the past 30 years was just over 10 mm (0.4 in). Although there is more precipitation towards the coast, the average across the continent is low enough to classify Antarctica as a polar desert.

So while Antarctica may be covered in ice, it has taken an incredible 45 million years to grow to its current thickness, because so little rain falls there.

As well as being one of the driest continents on Earth, Antarctica is also the coldest, windiest and highest.

        Australia is wider than the moon.This might sound strange, but it’s true. Australia’s diameter is about 600 kilometers wider than the moon’s. The moon is about 3,400 kilometers in diameter, while Australia measures about 4,000 kilometers from east to west. Of course, the moon is a sphere, which means it has a larger surface area, but this is a fun bit of trivia nonetheless.

Uluru’s surrounding rocks have long eroded away, leaving the massive sandstone rock that remains today.

Interestingly, it is also the highest point between the Himalayas and the Andes.
